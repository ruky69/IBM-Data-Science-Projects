# IBM-Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains tasks carried out during my IBM data science course including the final project called The Battle of the Neighborhood.
The tasks involve data wrangling, exploration of data analysis, development of machine learning models, evaluation and refinement of machine learning models, 
segementation and clustering of neighbourhoods in Canada using FourSquare API, and the final project, The Battle of the Neigbourhood. 
The repository contains 3 different type of files, which are python, pdf, and powerpoint. 
The powerpoint and pdf files contain the presentation and short report on what was done for the final project.
